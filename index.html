                        <p>I'm a Senior Undergrad student at UIC, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.</br></br>
                            
                            My coding journey began in High School at Taft High School in Chicago, where I graduated in 2021. It all started with a computer science class during my sophomore year, and I was immediately drawn to coding. 
                            During my senior year, amidst the challenges of COVID-19, I took an online Robotics class where we delved into Arduino programming. Despite the virtual setup, my teacher's dedication stood out as he even visited my home to provide me with an Arduino kit. 
                            That experience sparked my fascination with Arduino and solidified my decision to pursue a Computer Science major in college.</br></br>
                            
                            Since then, I've taken various CS classes such as Program Design I and II, Foundations of Computing, Programming Practicum, Data Structures, Machine Organization, Software Design, Languages and Automata, Systems Programming, Computer Design, and
                            Programming Language Concepts.
                        </br>
                            Each class has contributed significantly to my growth and passion for the field.

                            My role was to support incoming freshmen in building connections and enhancing their leadership abilities. </p>

                            Chicago EDT, a robotics club at UIC, holds a special place for me as it was my first club during my first semester. Despite the excitement of preparing for a competition at Urbana Champaign, 
                            COVID-19 forced its cancellation. In the club, we focused on three types of robots: air, ground, and moon robots. I chose to work with the air robot, which operates like a drone. 
                            Its mission was to collect ballpit balls and shoot them towards another robot, presenting a fascinating technical challenge.

                            many of whom I still cherish as friends today. The staff members, mentors, and fellow participants all contributed to my learning journey, offering valuable insights
                             and experiences that have stayed with me.

                            I also serve as a mentor in the MentorSHPE program, helping guide and support fellow students in their academic and professional development.
                            One of my proudest accomplishments was organizing and hosting a professional headshot event before the UIC Career Fair. We had an amazing turnout, 
                            with around 80 participants. I personally took the headshots, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
