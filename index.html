                        <p>I am currently a Junior Undergrad student at UIC majoring in Computer Science with concentration in Software Engineering<br><br>
                            My very first ever coding experience was when I was in High School. I went to Taft High School in Chicago, and graduated in 2021. 
                            I took a computer science class on my sophomore year and I was captivated with coding. 
                            On my senior year of high school, I took a Robotics class, it was an online class because it was during covid, but that didn't stop us from learning Arduino. 
                            My teacher went to my house to give me an Arduino kit, that was my first time working with Arduino, and I was really fascinated of what it can do. 
                            From there, I decided I'm going to major in Computer Science for college. So far, I have taken a scattering number of CS classes including 
                            Program Design I and II, Foundations of Computing, Programming Practicum, Data Structures, Machine Organization, and Software Design.

                            to covid, the competition was canceled. There were three robots to work on: air, ground, and the moon robot. I decided to work with
                            the air robot. The robot is like a drone type robot. The robot's objective is to collect a ballpit balls and shoot it to another robot.
