                        <p>I'm currently a Junior Undergrad student at UIC, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.</br></br>
                            
                            My coding journey began in High School at Taft High School in Chicago, where I graduated in 2021. It all started with a computer science class during my sophomore year, and I was immediately drawn to coding. 
                            During my senior year, amidst the challenges of COVID-19, I took an online Robotics class where we delved into Arduino programming. Despite the virtual setup, my teacher's dedication stood out as he even visited my home to provide me with an Arduino kit. 
                            That experience sparked my fascination with Arduino and solidified my decision to pursue a Computer Science major in college.</br></br>
                            
                            Since then, I've taken various CS classes such as Program Design I and II, Foundations of Computing, Programming Practicum, Data Structures, Machine Organization, Software Design, Languages and Automata, Systems Programming, and Computer Design.
                            Each class has contributed significantly to my growth and passion for the field.

                                    Me and my team of four implemented a renting website for the campus that helps other students by lending them an item they need. 
                                    The website was completed using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.</li>

                                    Worked and collaborated with a team of five to complete â€œGreen Stations" a themed project about Sustainable Innovation, in less than 24 hours. 
                                    Constructed a project aimed at helping students locate different stations that could help reduce the carbon footprint, stations such as EV Charging stations, Bike stations, Recycling stations, and Solar charging stations
                                    Completed the app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Applied HERE Technologies API to locate the specific locations of the stations.</li>

                            Ignite was a pivotal leadership program for me during my freshman year at UIC. I began as a mentee and then transitioned to become a mentor in the fall semester of 2022. 
                            My role was to support incoming freshmen in building connections and enhancing their leadership abilities. </p>

                            Chicago EDT, a robotics club at UIC, holds a special place for me as it was my first club during my first semester. Despite the excitement of preparing for a competition at Urbana Champaign, 
                            COVID-19 forced its cancellation. In the club, we focused on three types of robots: air, ground, and moon robots. I chose to work with the air robot, which operates like a drone. 
                            Its mission was to collect ballpit balls and shoot them towards another robot, presenting a fascinating technical challenge.

                            I attended a regional conference to represent UIC, where I had the chance to learn from inspiring leaders and meet new faces.
