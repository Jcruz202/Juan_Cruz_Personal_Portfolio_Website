                            Similar to Huffman coding, the objective of this program is to compress a 
                            file to reduce its size without losing any detail. In the app it will first ask you to build a 
                            frequency map and choose if it's a file or a string. It will then build an encoding tree, then build 
                            an encoding map. After that, it will encode the file or the string, then you can decode it after. 
                            It will then ask you to free the memory that was allocated. Finally, you will have an option to compress and 
                            decompress the file. </p>

                            and the colors of each bars are shown by the different category. The frames updates by 50000 microsecond 
                            for the animation effect. This program was also tested thoroughly and made sure that there are no memory leaks. </p>
